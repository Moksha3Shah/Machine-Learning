considering the fact that a procrastinator's constant worry is to get a particular job done not exactly crib over the quality. however it remains the case that many a times we postpone an important or difficult task simply because we fear that we may not perform upto the mark or achieve the level of perfection needed. we take the easy way out and scarcely try. so in the event of a failure atleast we won't be disappointed that our efforts didn't amount to much considering we hadn't put in much of an effort in the first place. there's always a chance of failure in any endeavour. success is not guaranteed. but the only chance of succeeding is by trying. next time you are tempted to procrastinate give yourself a chance at succeeding and take a leap of faith. you will always be thankful for the chances you took. \", \"  it was while searching for a spiritual book in a literature fest i happened to find a masterpiece of dr justin o'brien 'superconscious meditation'. this is an

system values or behavior that person somehow threatens how we perceive ourselves research has found that people tend to overestimate personality and underestimate the situation when making attributions especially with people they do not know well. when we make attributions for people we know well and care about this tendency flips. our brains are wired to make automatic judgements about others behaviors so that we can move through the world without spending too much time or energy on understanding everything we see. well let's be honest you cannot stop yourself from judging someone.

we are different our paths are different. then why do we have to weigh each other when there are no commonalities   most of us think that skin care is solely about the externals factors like cleansing usage of suitable creams and face packs which benefit in the nourishment and glow of the skin. but in fact the internal factors too must be taken into account for a healthy skin. your skin is a window towards all the internal reactions in your body. like how you can witness the formation of pimples whenever there is a good intake of oily food. a clear distinction can be traced out from the people who solely depend on external skin care routines and those who balance between their external routines and internal diet. fruits and green veggies are the best in terms of a good diet for skin. the more fruits you consume the more glowing your skin will become. green veggies and pulses provide enough nutrients and vitamins which act as antioxidants for your skin and protects your skin from damage and inflammation. an unhealthy diet can cause pimples and pigmentation.thus a healthy diet would help you retain a youthful skin.   there is much wisdom in the classic saying men's sana in corpore sana which means a sound mind in a sound body. the above quote emphasizes on the importance of the mind and body and the fact that the health of one is connected to that of the other. a youthful active and energetic mind slows down the aging process. lack of mental exercise reduces the ability to respond to the surroundings. it has been proven that a fixed routine halts the thinking capacity as the brain gets habituated to the drill set by the individual. neurons nerve cells of a person start aging in their twenties but it can be slowed by the intellectual activity curiosity and desire to learn. exposure towards a change getting out of the comfort zone is one of the effective ways to increase the mental strength. interaction with people playing a sport painting dancing etc are different scenarios where one can divert from their routine as it offers new stimuli and helps in preventing depression that can come with solitude.   not just a background... people nowdays have become less appriciative maybe intentionally or maybe not.. art has lost all of its love somewhere around the world. people have reduced it into their social media enhancer without any understanding of it. art has its way as amere background of people's selfies. people never undestood the effort and imagination behind it or maybe never wnated to undestand it. art could so much more. it heals motivates and relates to you. explore around go appriciate and learn art you will find yourself more attentive and assertive towards the things places and people you never knew existed. then spread the knowledge you gained on your social media instead of just picture without any prior understanding of the art they involved! bring up the change be the change don't just use the art rather savour it and respect it!   our society defines beauty based on the colour shape and size of one s body. men and women both suffer from body shaming. a boy is expected to be tall and muscular with a physique which makes him appear strong. a girl is expected to be thin fair skinned short with a flawless skin. media has played a significant role in promoting the culture of body shaming all the advertisements of cosmetics are preaching how it is absolutely essential to run after a fairer skin in order to get a job and or fianc e while many food item advertisements are reminding us how crucial it is to lose fat within days in order to look attractive in a party. instead of judging people just because they don t look as we want them to we need to be more mature accepting and empathetic. taking a step a time let s feel comfortable in our own skin and let s give others the freedom to practice the same. let s practice self acceptance love and tolerance.   like stars are to sky so are children to this world. block quote they are tender and need proper care to grow. but sadly there are so many children in our country who crave for love and affection they have no one to look after them. they are either orphan or are left by their families. humans attract humanity! we all can help such children by adopting them. i don't say all but atleast one child. this will not only give the child a new lease of life but will also help in family planning and adoption can be a blessing for the one's who can't have a child of their own. children are an asset of the country. if we'll not look after them then how can we hope for a good future so what if the child is not your blood this doesn't invalidates him from becoming your family. all you need is to give it a thought and change your mindset.   you see his six pack abs and ripped physique i wish i could have something like that the uniformly widespread thoughts of any average millennial. actually we have been conditioned to put emphasis on this. we see ads or other fashion events where those fitness models flaunt themselves. and as much as i've no issues with it it's high time now that we address the reality for us looks matter what may the cost be. it's no wonder that a whole bunch of gymmers use steroid because it makes it easy to put up that extra pounds to your muscle mass. indeed without a proper knowledge it's tempting to fall into these things. not talking about all the side effects it results in we have a flawed sense of fitness in our minds. we do not give much importance to our well being and what we inject in our bodies but instead we just want to look good in the shirtless mirror picture to upload it on insta.   while the beauty companies are provocatively creating new formula to keep you young and beautiful  it is more than essential to rememberemember that age is preety. every age has a taste of its own and comes with its own camouflaged wisdom and beauty. not everyone likes to be called that stereotyping age is also aan orthodox handicap in the society. your age is beautiful and hiding iit by laser surgeries by being proper gangnam beauty is not a bad thing either but the point should be clear that old and wiser is far better off than young and stupid! being comfortable in your own skin and dancing in your character is the key to happiness and as they say your age is what you look like  so stop chasing cosmetics and start chasing the door to your heart!   alcohols form a crucial part of our skin care and most of us analyse them as harsh bad ingredient. while this is true to some extent it is false for same extent too. hence to simplify the things we are here presenting a list which is not exclusive though. this list jot down the alcohols

understand the reality we are living in. we must try to collect as much information about it as we can. we should learn how the world works. we should understand physics social interactions and constructs economics politics sciences. there is just the matter of how much a person is willing to do. we need to ignore those obstacles which tell us there are limits to everything. we to work hard

some people journaling is actually a really good habit. it helps to increase our creativity decrease stress levels. in today's modern generation people are so busy with their lives they forget to take

how busy we are let us all take the time to appreciate the little things around us take joy in being alive and able to see and feel them. who knows it might just be what we need.   protein is

since i didn't have my sewing kit with me and was too busy to go to the market . she sewed it for me in my absence and told me to let her know anytime my clothes are torn. to others this is not a big deal but to me the thoughtful act meant a lot. i realized that kindness doesn't have to be in the form of money or material things but in the little acts we do to ease the burden of others to make them feel welcome. a little kindness indeed goes a long way and you don't have to be rich to show it   most of the time people are confused with the words love and attraction and end up mixing the two. but one needs to understand the significance of each. love is something that takes time to grow whereas attraction can take place at any time of the day. you can feel attracted to a particular quality as that quality vanishes then you are no more attracted to that person. love is all about setting free whereas attraction is all about possession. love is all about giving whereas attraction is all about seeking. love does not expect anything whereas the base of attraction is expectation. attraction is temporary love but love is nothing but permenant attraction.   real luxury lifestyle

true that everyone worries about something or the other. it's natural to feel anxious. there will never be a time life when life is simple. you will continue to face challenges at work relationships health financial matters etc. but too much worrying about anything that has happened or likely to happen isn't good. it just takes away your time to do something fruitful now and pushes you into a lot of stress. all that you need to get out of that phase is a change of perspective. think of what you can do to change the situation. focus on things that are right about the situation. think of solutions. another way to deal with worrying is to channelize that energy into something else. go for a run clean your wardrobe take a walk and do things that will engage your hands and legs. this

promote through their product. because the consumers of the brands are unaware hence brands are encashing it. therefore let me through a light on this concept.

'natural products' are the combination of naturally growing products safer chemicals. hence please don't hate the word 'chemicals' because you stomach your body water everything has chemicals. products that are liquid or contains water needs to have preservatives and hence not natural. brands refraining from writing complete ingredients list are fooling consumers. brands claiming 'natural' may or may not be one. be aware!

'the dice won't always roll against you someday they will be in your favour.' the above line may seem enticing only to a gambler on first sight but it holds true for all of our struggles in life.we have to keep trying to get up even after falling down. true self improvement comes when we struggle and embrace our failures. the world doesn't treat striving people like sisyphus the greek king who was cursed to roll a rock uphill for eternity only to see it tumbling back down again rather it rewards them the fruits of their labour sooner or later. trying endlessly doesn't imply being monotonic and rigid in the approach to facing challenges or willingly accepting defeat in one's endeavours. perserverance means to innovate improvise and imbibe our struggles with the knowledge of our shortcomings a puzzle different for everyone. when overcoming the shortcomings becomes second nature to us only then are we truly improving. persistence is the greatest prescription for self improvement muscles become stronger only when strained and torn.   persistence. a word which is commonly overlooked upon in this current age and time. with anything available with just the touch of

everything stands against the final output. it is nothing but harsh reality that in some part of the journey towards success complications or obstacles may stand in your path blocking you from your actual goal and it is in times like this when persistence plays a crucial role. the fight between the conscious and subconscious mind to keep trying and moving on and most importantly to not quit and

where you genuinely regret what you did from the core of your heart where it's emtirely obvious to the other person that you regret it is entirely dfferent. adults labour under the delusion that apologizing shows weakness. it doesn't. we ve reached a day and age where acknowledging one's mistakes is something to be proud of rather than being a weakness. blaming others making excuses is easy. taking the blame ourselves is not. plucking up the courage to say sorry acknowledging it's your fault can be a daunting task but it's worth every ounce of the effort. it is a stellar moment in relationships. as we strive for self improvement it s vital to recognize our own mistakes. nobody is perfect. we all make mistakes. the trick is to acknowledge them. apologizing doesn't mean that you're wrong others are right. it means you love someone more than your ego. choose love above pride. learn to apologize to say sorry.   the scorpio born are strong willed passionate. the sign of extremes and intensity only selected few ones will get near them. focused if they have decided on something nothing can divert them. brave scorpions will never lose their sleep over disruptive failure. balanced they are jovial passionate and childish at the same time. faithful they are trustworthy and faithful. if they have promised to stand by you no matter what they will. ambitious scorpions are ambitious lot. they will aim for the stars and ensure that they outreach there. intuitive they mostly take the right decisions at the right time. they can easily read the mind of people. secretive they find it extremely difficult to trust people and are therefore very secretive. the scorpio will not let people easily know what's going on in their mind or life. manipulative scorpio born have a knack of getting things done their way. although they are sensitive and considerate they can become extremely ruthless especially when they are supposed to take tough firm decisions and so no emotions can hinder them.   we all know that the above mentioned topic is a very demanding topic of any debate. somewhere we all are little unsure of taking a step related to our own life. the very first dilemma in most of us is that should we follow our heated passion or so called secure job route let's see some facts related to passion and any secure route in pursuing our passion work does not come across with a stress or pressure on us. boredom is not having any existence along with the passion and we can perform even much better. passion is a commitment to ourselves but in any secure route that so called commitment vanishes. while chasing our dreams or passion we put our heart and soul into it and nobody tells us to do so it comes from within. and that's how we always do our work without stress. life is all about enjoyment not money. remember one thing chase your dreams and success remains. live your life by fulfilling your dreams and passion along with happiness!!   self improvement is a thing as natural as human existence in the world. it is a personal journey not a race with others. you must believe in yourself and perspicuity in life. most of the human beings are challenged both physically and mentally they push themselves to be better and to be against their self made extent that only obstruct their path to progress. one thing you want to know is personal growth will lead to success. once you know what you want to do and what you are comfortable with you will have bigger goals like career family future etc. reading the inspiring author books and watching videos on youtube for minutes a day gets people to want a better life and set a goal to achieve for themselves. a person makes sure that they have positive thinking it is up to the person to decide how he she harvests the power of his her brain. it transforms many lives and completely different perspectives of life. thus i conclude by the most famous quote those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything. george bernard shaw.   we all have struggled failed and surged ahead in search of happiness and contentment. all we have to do is hold on to that positive attitude. embed type image source https media .giphy.com media lcezaydalwnqfqzws giphy.gif cid f dae f f cbf c c bc fcb be bd rid giphy.gif believe in yourself. always believe in yourself. no matter how bad your day went always be grateful for your life. you can do anything. do what you love. don't think about what other people might think about you because in the end it is your life and your decision to make. try something new. never be scared of trying something new. if you want to do something then just do it. you might be good at or bad at it. you won't know unless you will try. so stop having second thoughts and do what you always wanted to do. admit your mistakes. sometimes you only have to admit you mistakes to others. it only takes two words to start a whole new relationship with someone. and an apology will never make you a small person   self improvement just not simply means improving yourself but finding out what is actually wrong in you and then improving yourself. self evaluation is the key to self improvement. we should self evaluate ourselves often because it helps in developing a personality. it eventually helps us in achieving success in every step of our life. there is no perfect age to look into yourself and decide where you are going wrong. it is true that knowledge makes you intellectual but being wise takes more. doing this at regular intervals of time will ensure that you do not lag behind your competitors and never face any kind of guilt. nowadays we youngsters really get offended when anyone tries to correct us or tell us to improve ourselves. so it's better to know our mistakes and correct them in time. these habits when inculcated from childhood are easier to learn and adapt. if you want people to remember you always then you should totally have a remarkable personality that sends positive vibes around.   what comes to your mind first when you read or hear 'self improvement' whatever your answer is that's the very issue you consciously or subconsciously believe in improving in yourself. now the next question that strikes you is how to achieve that if this question naturally struck you then congratulations you're on the right path! but if it didn't well now it must. relax! you should know that you're being presented with two choices evolve or repeat. this journey will take time and that's completely fine. believe you can reach your destination and you're halfway there! improve yourself not because you want to impress someone else but because you genuinely want to be good enough that you no more face an issue in the area your 'journey' is in. though that might help but if you yourself arent' lucid enough about the journey you might be treated with adversity. in fine let's strive to use the following statement as much as possible if you knew me yesterday you probably don't know me because i grow daily.   if you sit back relax and think what introspection is you'll hear one thing for sure and that's your innervoice. honest opinion of what you are. nobody in this world is perfect not even your favourite rolemodles but it's not like you can't get there well you can can atleast try. self development comes from the will to change oneself. it can never be achieved if not done from the heart. it's no goldman's work the cure is with you and the one who's going to cure is you yourself. well i think that's the best tutorial one can ever ask for. i hit rock bottom in past at a particular time when i had no friends when i relied and invested in wrong people. yes i cried but after a bit you get tired of the crying too and one day you say get a grip . i'm sure we all have such days of ours. what pushes you is the will to improve yourselves.   as we go on about our lives we tend to face a lot of challenges some challenges seem tougher than the rest and we start to think that we are fragile and giving up seems like an easier option. however what we don t realise is that we are much stronger than the problem in hand and the fact that we can work on ourselves to overcome the obstacle ahead will help us eventually. i have had my fair share of failures in life at the age of  and at times i felt weak demotivated and felt like i have hit rock bottom. but as they say extreme circumstances are a powerful way to trigger a change in perspective and that s what happened. the day we stop being bitter about something that is not going our way and start working on ourselves is the day we have arrived at a turning point in our lives. just ask one question to yourself  how do you choose to live your life   applying serum is the third step to skincare and this is the curing stage of skin. it means directly applying concentrates onto our skin based on skin concerns. as a result you can choose vitamin c serum for pigmentation hyaluronic acid for dry flaky skin etc. also if you start using the basic serum at an early stage you can prevent some skin care concerns as well. after cleansing and toning the pores of our skin are most absorbing towards the products we are going to use on our skin. here comes the benefit of a serum. serums are basically a blend of some facial oils such as lavender oil avocado oil pumpkin oil etc. hence on applying concentrates at the most absorbing stage of skin provides the fastest healing. serums are used in droplets at once only and little goes a long way. if you have oily skin a serum may break you out due to maximum absorption but try to find the ingredient that broke you and next time chooses a serum not having that ingredient.   people eat a lot of junk food and spend their day without any exercise. one night they wake up from their sleep and start thinking about their fitness as they felt very embarrassing walking with that tummy in front of others at the party that night. and now comes the real problem whether to join yoga classes or a gym. they spend their whole night thinking about these choices and google about it. basically gym is recommended for people who are particular about muscle building. but yoga is always recommended from gym. yoga is completely focusing on yourselves and reduces stress. yoga improves your breathing ability. yoga makes you lean. yoga improves concentration. anyone can practise it. after spending their whole night watching and learning about yoga they keep alarms to get up early in the following morning. but as usual they miss their alarm and skip to their daily routine which has no space for fitness. but there are some people who take this very seriously and start practising yoga and make their life much better than usual.   don't talk drugs to her she is the drug. she is a weed so organic your dopamine levels raised this high first you pretend to laugh and then you go to cry.

that refers to the way individuals seek and express meaning and purpose and the way they experience their connectedness to the moment to self to others to nature and to the significant or sacred. so basically spirituality is nothing but being connected to yourself your surroundings without the physical materialistic things being a factor. many of us find questioning the way things work the world us and the mere existence of this whole world but seldom find an answer to it. this is where spirituality comes in play the whole concept of being alive and being a life comes in. we often stuff our heads with so many tasks that mental health just becomes a fitness goal that we would some fine day achieve. so now what actually is spirituality   first and foremost identifing that one is under emotional abuse at your own level. then identify the abuser because abusing rise from the source in your realtion circle only. and then by being honest about what you are experiencing you can begin to take control of your life again. some other practise to perfrom for freedom is do something that will help you think positive and affirm who you are be sure to get an appropriate amount of rest and eat healthy meals. self care steps can go a long way in helping you deal with the day to day stresses of emotional abuse. talk to a trusted friend family member or even a counselor about what you are experiencing establish boundaries with the abuser if possible depending on your situation you may need to take steps to end the relationship   amidst the ebullient and jolly mob you stand solitarily demented. the conspicuous charisma of 'cool crowd' have tempted you. you are struggling to revamp yourself you're trying to be cool and exuberant. what other's think about you matter more than what you about yourself. while trying so hard the qualities which differentiate you from others are fading. at this juncture ponder retrospect and ask yourself a question are you happy with the new self no. you are still the one whose weekends aren t about parties but quality time with people you value. western songs don't amuse you evergreen melodies soothe your mind. you prefer reading books over 'netflix and chill'. these peculiarities do not make you aberrant. just halt the chaos inside you live life on your ethics there's nothing selfish in demanding more for yourself. at least it will retain you from living in ' existential crisis'. uplift your eyes and revive your conscience. you are someone who has not recognized true self and needs to explore a lot.   sunscreens the top layer on skin care meant not to seep in but to bounce back the uv sunrays coming to harm your skin. before going much deep first let's see what fda said recently about it harmful ingredients paba and trolamine salicylate. safer ingredients zinc oxide titanium dioxide. put a cap on spf at major ingredients in most chemical sunscreens includes oxybenzone octinoxate which causes damage to coral reefs . though our ancestors never used sunscreen please be noted that they lived in an environment different from us. there was a thicker ozone layer and lesser pollution those days but now the situation is entirely different. also the sunlight which provides us vitamin d is not the afternoon one but the sunlight in the early morning during or near the dawn. hence using sunscreen is as important as covering your face with a scarf in the damn heat on the burning roads.   fibers are non digestable carbohydrates present in the food items also known as roughage. it has been classified into two

ideaology of the naive begetter would it all be over or was it gonna be a start would the dragon and the begetter ever find peace and successfully meet on the other side   everyone goes through various phases of life  at one phase everything seems to be going your way but at other you feel like everything is pulling you down. but the question is should one loose hope and keep complaining or look for solutions here is what one should do ask yourself is it really a problem  is it going to affect me after years from now  various times we just create problems in our head and let it dominate our psyche. accept and face when you accept that it is actually a problem  you stop feeding it to grow more. here you know it won't be solved untill you face it. remember you're not only person facing such issues  there are people who have already gone through it. ask them about their experience and solution for the same. every problem or life situation teaches you the important lessons of your life all you need is to see problem situation as an opportunity to take some positive out of it. it is what life is.   one of the important reasons for procrastination is 'need for perfection'. it seems ironic considering the fact that a procrastinator's constant worry is to get a particular job done not exactly crib over the quality. however it remains the case that many a times we postpone an important or difficult task simply because we fear that we may not perform upto the mark or achieve the level of perfection needed. we take the easy way out and scarcely try. so in the event of a failure atleast we won't be disappointed that our efforts didn't amount to much considering we hadn't put in much of an effort in the first place. there's always a chance of failure in any endeavour. success is not guaranteed. but the only chance of succeeding is by trying. next time you are tempted to procrastinate give yourself a chance at succeeding and take a leap of faith. you will always be thankful for the chances you took.   it was while searching for a spiritual book in a literature fest i happened to find a masterpiece of dr justin o'brien 'superconscious meditation'. this is an international bestseller. dr justin o'brien or swami jaidev bharti is a philosopher theologian wellness expert yogi and the main teacher at the institute of himalayan tradition. he is the disciple of swami rama. this book is a simple guide to the art of meditation. it explains the entire subtle and painless method. it gives us the freedom to conduct our lives in an intelligent peaceful and creative manner. through this one can get rid of the inside fears lingering hesitations about life anxieties so as to make unbiased choices in life. i personally liked the last part of this book 'its not what you think!' it suggests that we can achieve all possible aims in life through meditation. we are ourselves a part of the supreme and can find the true meaning of life through it. i highly recommend this book to everyone because it suggests a wonderful method of meditation.   most of us probably don t believe we need a formal definition of happiness we know it when we feel it and we often use the term to describe a range of positive emotions including joy contentment and gratitude. some believe happiness is in serving the god as by the bible psalm those who look to him for help will be radiant with joy no shadow of shame will darken their faces. according to gandhi happiness is when what you think what you say and what you do are in harmony. scientifically happiness is used in the context of mental or emotional states including positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy. it is also used in the context of life satisfaction subjective well being. embed type image source https media .giphy.com media rdma ndfzmr giphy.gif cid f db c df ef df cda ee ee d a rid giphy.gif psychologically happiness in its broad sense is the label for a family of pleasant emotional states such as joy amusement satisfaction and euphoria. a happy person experiences the spectrum of emotions just like anybody else but the frequency with which they experience the negative ones differ. so  what's your definition of happiness   you and i we judge others. and they judge us. we all do it. sometimes we judge with positive or non harming intentions. unfortunately our judgment often comes from a negative place with darker intent. but why do we judge people maybe because we don t know a person well yet we cannot identify with a person s belief system values or behavior that person somehow threatens how we perceive ourselves research has found that people tend to overestimate personality and underestimate the situation when making attributions especially with people they do not know well. when we make attributions for people we know well and care about this tendency flips. our brains are wired to make automatic judgements about others behaviors so that we can move through the world without spending too much time or energy on understanding everything we see. well let's be honest you cannot stop yourself from judging someone. because it happens so spontaneously that you can't stop that tendency. but what you can do is to ensure that your judgement is not affecting that individual.   there's a beautiful line i heard which has stuck with me ever since saying some people have a mental illness but everyone has a mental health . its considered people talk about mental health only when they have a problem regarding it. our mental health is as important for us to take care of as our physical health. mostly seperating them out neglecting the mental aspect as their functioning are different but its important that we understand that they are interlinked as well. we tend to put extra effort onour bodies to get in desired shapes but what about our minds we need extra efforts to shape our minds aswell ! one way is by flitering what we're feeding our brains what kind of issues are we being engaged in and news are we taking in. practicing mindfulness techniques like meditation and yoga is a great way of being self aware of our thoughts and inner environment. our education system societies and families might have shaped up a certain way now its on us how we shape ourselves.   don't have a smart tv are you at the mercy of your

the desired goal s in the most straightforward of ways. embed type image source https media .giphy.com media rsltgroccr s giphy.gif cid f d b d a f bb f rid giphy.gif an effective planning creates focus helps in time management generates as well as saves energy. a good planning is generally dynamic in nature that helps to tackle situations with the minimum of efforts. it's more of outcome based. a well strategize planning keeps track of our progress on the path towards goal. it helps to point out mistakes and enhances the ability of not repeating them in times ahead. results start occurring positively for us. and that takes us closer to our goals. effective planning builds shared commitment not compliance. thus we can see how much powerful planning indeed is   in that murky night as i was lost in my musings a music so harmonious kept approaching my ears. filling that sweet tune into my veins. making me recall those humming rains. when she used to play ukulele b true with

numerous reasons which boost depression but only one thing which stimulates it lack of communication. depression strikes when you do not openly talk to anyone about it. any bad memory which is hijacking your mind and you're not letting it out is the first step to depression. embed type image source https media .giphy.com media kpxjiwbtguize giphy.gif cid f df b e e c c c c e acdcbe e cc rid giphy.gif if anything bad that happened which you are not talking about then that memory becomes spiderweb in your head which later gives birth to depression. eg. teenagers not talking to their parents or parents not talking to their kids you're not talking about the guilt you hold inside etc. the bad things which our mind collects which we don't throw out is depression. it's the same as a trash bin filled with trash. what do you do if the bin gets overloaded with trash you throw it out. same way the bad memory or anything which is holding you back throw it out too. speak about it with someone trustable. it will reduce the burden from your head and will never let you be the victim of depression.   in a modern fast paced and overly sensible age sometimes it becomes necessary to revisit the romanticist that lives in each one of us. romanticism i true was the artistic movement of the eighteenth century characterized by emphasis on imagination nature and melancholia. although definitions are all well and good they go against the very idea of romanticism which sought above all to get away from the labels and the rigid walls that up to that point guarded what art in this case poetry could be. before the movement poetry had been looked at in a disciplined and formal manner which is not only funny but inherently wrong. poetry is undefinable. one cannot expect to bind it down with chains for it is a wild expression of thought and emotion of all things that make us human. it is formless and exists nowhere except for in the soul of a reader who has been moved i true by it. poetry is bizarre and beautiful and we owe it to the romantic movement for being able to see poetry like we do today.   when every soul alive locked down at home though dead inside is searching numerous ways to fight this lonely mental battle at home the studios and determined soul will turn this monotonous quarantine days to the best phase to tread through the peak of success.to be honest though it gets too boring sometimes to handle the situation but in reality it's the only moment where you can accelerate to catch that butterfly which just escaped from you. the whole of universe has bowed down to this long lasting battle with wuhan outburst covid .the superheroes are labouring tirelessly to fight this tough battle and protect.when though nation is passing through a tough time young budding artists at home in a safe environment can work and strategize on their individual talent to furnish it and turn it into a masterpiece. life runs at its own usual pace and the warriors fighting the battle always earn moments to bleed in the training and not in the battlefield.in this quarantine let's pledge not to procrastinate and rather become picasso in every undertaking.   human beings have never failed to fascinate the world with their creative power and talent. they have built marvellous monuments and cities conquered time and space and have explored the world beyond the horizon. but perhaps the greatest and most powerful treasure we could gift ourselves would be the world of books. reading quotes sir francis bacon  maketh a full man . every great thinker is an avid reader. their minds are the store house of wisdom knowledge and imagination. the more he reads the more he exhibit incredible values. reading literature helps an individual to build his career by improving his communication and language skills. it also contributes to the overall performance of an individual by enhancing him emotionally mentally and academically. books opens to him a different world of imagination which ultimately supports him to think out of the box. even though books are primarily viewed from an entertainment point of view they underline and promote many essential qualities necessary for the survival of humans thereby presenting them as the better future of the nation.   from childhood to being an adult we've been told how important it s to read. we are given books to lure us into reading when we are small and by the time we're an adult we ve a reading list that we'll never finish. the level of peace we achieve by reading is incomparable and therefore it s as important to read right as it s to eat. as a literature student i saw a lot of my batch mates who took up literature as a major in college for the wrong reasons regretting their decisions later. the reason was simple they never knew the meaning of serious literature. all they ever read were overtly romanticized novels written by authors who didn t know a thing about literature. the serious literature is about virginia woolf whose single sentence started a new period it s about mary shelley whose famous novel awed people as much as they scared and disgust them. serious literature s motive is not to give pleasant feelings all the time but to invoke emotions in you no matter what they makes you feel.   art. we've heard of visual arts performing arts applied arts. these contain numerous professions like painting architecture photography etc. everyday people pick up new things set new goals for life eventually making a career out of one of these arts. but in this modern world where time moves so fast that people rarely take a moment for introspection there is one art that goes unnoticed time management. when there is cut throat competition in every possible sphere of life time management is what sets apart the extraordinary ones. be it a student engineer or a musician it is essential. working out an example let's see what a student's hours comprise of. classes usually gym homework everything else is pretty routine and even then the day goes by in a flash. what if there is a test or someone's birthday then the whole day goes haywire. and its much worse in professional life. so the bottomline is time management is not a mere skill anymore it's an art. and only the best artist can paint the perfect life.   lying on a bedsheet of filthy street with a blanket of mosquitoes besides a roadside lampshade casting silhouette of a man. this homeless man takes a dry gulp down the throat as dry as a bone. he is nothing but a scrawny skeleton thin like rails. thin like a paper. his gentle lips write you letters to feed him with whatever food left he has tasted only hunger ever since he was born. holding eyes of drowsiness which can no more hold tears. he screams for food like roaring drums ninety five times a day. a deafening sound only his organs can read. i wonder if his cheeks ever glow if he ever smirks or grins if he ever smiles back at you if he ever stood up and felt like life is good. i wonder how he survived the earlier days of his life. or am i just lucky that i can only wonder all this and not live a life like his   the most difficult time as per me for a student are vacations. some of you won't believe this but yes it really is. these vacations pose a great mental as well as physical challenge for them. about one week prior students start preparing numerous plans in their mind. but the most difficult thing is to choose the far reaching task among them. and we all know that choosing has been the most difficult job since ages. now for those who clear level  comes level of carrying out that task with same passion as that at the time of choosing because thirst dies when someone reaches the well. also they have to look after their physique too. going on trips or watching movies won't help much. and it will be icing on cake if they are winter vacations as they will help in making one more lazy. regular sports yoga jogging must be pulled off in order to not look homely. those who do the same tasks congrats! as i am still stuck between level and .   what do you consider as milestones in your life graduating high school college maintaining a full time job or being in a successul marriage i agree on the above mentioned stages of life but only upto a certain extend. are you enjoying those stages of life with a feeling of satisfaction or relief if it is from the latter then you have serious problem because it implies that the actions performed by you during those times were only because you were in a self suvival mode. you were only going through the motions doing tasks out of necessity rather than self fulfillment. we are given two lives and the second begins when we realise we have only one . i'm sure this quote resonants with many because most of us are concentrating on surviving but are we really living taking a break from normal life through travelling movie nights etc are now the trend but they soon will become the next routine of life. so i ask again are we really living because living means to spread yourself around the globe with love.   in today's world everybody has the ability

mandatory step. after the process of cleansing the dust from your pores of skin came out which are now hollow. because of this your skin will now accept any product to seep in. as a result it is really important to ensure that right products go inside the skin and to shrink them enough to avoid alien particles. toning shrinks the pores of the skin at one time yet ensuring appropriate seeping capacity of the skin. in other words it creates a filter to save the skin from bigger dust particles. during this step you may close your eyes spray the toner all over your face and let it get absorbed in the skin itself. otherwise you may have pumps of toner on your palm and can dab it onto your face. one such toner include rose or lavender water but beware of artificial ones available in

else's goals and forget what we actually want. of the people in the world are stressed and unhappy as they succumb to work pressure. the truth is that there is no utopia. we need to stop for a second

the book offers you and learn from each and every character's mistakes and victories. reading can prove to be the best guide for self improvement. i do believe something very magical can happen when you read a good book block quote j.k.rowling block quote   before giving a single person the right to validate your feelings your looks and your dreams take a moment. take a moment and contemplate whether that person deserves such kind of power or not. follow the given steps and decide make a list of things that person has done for you. cross out the things that made you feel hurt in any way without giving any justifications for their actions. now make a list that you ve done for yourself. cross out the things that made you feel hurt in any way. repeat from step until you re satisfied with the lists. analyse the two lists and if the first list is longer than the second then do some more things for yourself and add them to your list until your list ids longer than theirs. now you have the answer to your question. do not give others the right to validate your feelings emotions action or dreams. you are the only and the truest judge of yourself. you should not let anyone define you.   two thousand six hundred years ago gotama buddha arose in this country and taught pure dhamma resulting in great happiness for the world. people started living in accordance with this teaching.

of a human being contains about quarts of water. in fact many of our organs have amazingly high water content. for instance muscle is per cent water the liver is per cent water the brain is per cent water and the kidney is per cent water! but this body fluid is not pure water. it is actually a salt solution. why is this so according to one scientific theory all land animals including man are the descendants of organisms that arose and lived in the sea. the body huid of these creatures was sea water. when they emigrated to dry land they retained sea water as their body fluid. but the land is unable to provide enough salt in a natural way. since salt dissolves in water the solid land loses much of its salt into the rivers and oceans with rainwater. therefore the plants which grow in this .land do not contain enough salt. this is why animals that feed on plants desire salt.   embed type image source https media .giphy.com media azubcbfscyngc giphy.gif cid f d a bb b bf eebd b efe d c

outside we are comfortable in our chilled offices and rooms. but they too have drawbacks and affect our body adversely. there is a considerable effect on our respiratory system as it leads to the blockage of the nasal passage. it also leads to allergic infections dryness of eyes and triggers asthma. acs absorb humidity and cause dehydration. some people also suffer from headaches and lethargy when they have to stay or work in an air conditioned environment. although there are numerous side effects of cooling some of them can be prevented or reduced by managing the ventilation of the chambers. the maintenance of air conditioners is another important factor. it should be checked and fixed from time to time. the temperature should lie between to degree celcius. most of these

word sounds quite easy but it's actually not. most people get confused or go blank whenever they're asked to define simplicity. how ironic to define the simplest word we use complicated words and at last find out that they're not even worth satisfying. don't push hard to acquire simplicity it comes naturally from within. you'll know when it's time. success stories are never written until and unless you find the true self of yours. when you finally give up on putting so much effort on impressing others and being fancy you'll ultimately gain the extremely magnificent power of simplicity. and this will become your first stepping stone towards your destination. let your simplicity write the success story for you. when we crave for simplicity we are not after easier life. we are after life. dave brown block quote no words can actually define simplicity accurately. it is the most complicated word itself.   before i went to solve the confusion let's focus where the confusion lies.

took my plethora of efforts to reach there i'm sure it won't. i would do everything i can i true . what to eat do i need to tell you b true heading you must be thinking i'm going off topic but eating a light refreshing food is a must. prefer fruits over the baked biscuits dry fruits and curd over your oily supper and your favorite coffee to charge you up. i true so should i sleep b true heading ofcourse! you should. sleep for good hours it's you who decide at one go or in breaks. yes learn to be your master. i true   what according to you is the goal of a conversation. is it to form differences b w the conversators or to find out similar shared thoughts about the topic you are conversating on. i believe that finding common thoughts help you in almost every case. let's take a simple example to understand this in a better way. i am a shopkeeper and at our shop we don't take returns but still customers try to return goods now whenever i refuse them rudely bragging about rules they get angry and furious but when i explain them politely they understand and accept . this is how you can manipulate the conversation in you favor by replying politely. there are several other examples too and i want you to mention them form those examples by yourself representing your experiences or your observations. hope you people got some relevant context. i will see you people in the next article. till then reply politely . you can also refer to this fantastic book by munro leaf   what a beautiful but dangerous arrangement of words. yes it sounds unreasonable but can change the lives of many people. yes i know it's hard to buy from someone anonymous but many of today's leading minds have already proven this by leaving the whole world wonderstruck by their accomplishments. still if you do buy this or just a little bit interested then i'm flattered to share the universal mantra that can help you achieve anything if you truly aspire for that. if you wish to thrive for success and are eager to work for it passionately but being insanely stubborn like years old to have it that we are still inside. so if you have decided to unlock the beautiful and unique you in yourselves it's true many obstacles may arise in front of you. with us being persistent and committed till the end is the master key to unlock almost anything. everything around you depends on your stubbornness to beat all the odds lying in your path to reach your desired destination.   often do we face the dilemma whether our showering love at everyone all the time is correct or not. here are two stories which will clear this dilemma. story once mother sarada devi addressed a burglar as father and asked him to take her to dakshineswar. considering her as his daughter he and his wife accompanied sarada devi until the destination was reached. story swami vivekananda was once chased and attacked by a troop of monkeys. he was running away from them but they continued to chase and attack him. face the brutes!  said a meditator who has been observing all this. swami vivekananda turned back and gave a fierce look to those monkeys which got scared and ran away. conclusion sarada devi was able to change a burglar by calling him father. however one shouldn t expect swami vivekananda to address those monkeys as brothers and ask them not to attack him. running away from the attackers or attacking them shouldn't be considered. one fierce look or a word would suffice to stop them from further attacking.   what is bought must be sold eventually. buying at the right price ensure ultimate returns. buying is supported by selling because it determines your actual profit. consider factors when you sell a stock. when it hits target when we choose to buy a stock it requires analysis. the analysis includes what a stock worth. greed and emotion overcame rational judgment. it's not a casino game. don't get fooled by greed if your stock moves up from target. better opportunity if you find another stock at the right valuation and have a tendency to appreciate more than existing. consider selling an option. change in business it has been seen stock often falls after a change in business. it includes the change in management change in business pattern acquisitions merger and demergers. fault in investment an investor should quickly look up for information when they find fault in their investment style. sell it when you find valuation is overvalued or there is various risk associated with it.   whey protein is the mixture of the protein

which was initiated by monks and or priests residing in the indian subcontinent. meditation has multifaceted benefits which includes reduction in blood pressure as well as symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and flare ups in people who have had ulcerative colitis. it may ease symptoms of anxiety and depression and may help many people with insomnia. there are many types of meditation but most have four elements in commom a quiet location wih negligible distractions a proper posture a focus of attention such as the sensations of breath and an open attitude that is not getting bothered by distractions. the core idea of meditation is not to quiet the brain but to train it to be more focused and to be in the present. in the beginning people tend to find it very tedious and boring but in the long run the qualities that it imparts are commendable and helpful in all arenas of life   for an indian 'roti kapda aur makaan' are top priorities as far as concerned. we are emotionally attached

abilities and his actions as no greater and no lesser than they really are. real humility then mandates that a man knows and is completely honest with himself. he honestly assesses what are and to

our kitchens as well adding fennel to pickles for example. lets understand it via an example. suppose there is a papaya facewash. now think how much will raw papaya last of you pack it in a bottle and keep it on your shelf may be a few days. natural organic products lasts shorter because the preservatives used in them if used  are the ones obtained directly from 'mother earth' which can provide a limited shelf life. however years of life to aqueous products products with water as ingredient shows presence of strong chemical preservatives. ps please note that oils naturally have huge lives. water based products tend to get damage more than those not having water.   loving ourselves works miracles in our life . louise l hay block quote all of us are busy in our lives trying to achieve our goals. in this busy life what we loose midway is love and peace of mind. sometimes we become so obsessed with our career and ambition that we seem to forget everything else. at the end of the day we crave for love. we all have a strong notion so deeply embedded in us that love comes from outside. why do we need someone to care for us when we have ourselves to love us. today most of us face serious depression because of the lack of self love. we are not able to find time for ourselves. but in order to be mentally healthy we need to take some time off for some self care. reward your body for what it is doing for you. give it some rest take good care of it. congratulate yourself for even the smallest things that you have achieved. love yourself more and more because you are worth it.

head. embed type image source https media .giphy.com media wi zgadcpy f giphy.gif cid f d f a c b efad bd c b d f cc c rid giphy.gif but time changes we come to know that our childhood dream is just a dream that is nowhere near reality. we don't want it to come true or our circumstances don't demand it. we are no longer that 'kid' and accordingly our dream shifts. we no longer want to make planes or become doctor even we give up the idea of being famous instead we want a peaceful life with a family of three or four. and it should be. in our childhood we construct dreams based on our small world we were blind about the happenings of the outer world. so if your childhood dreams not changed that means you are still residing in a small portion of your head and need to come out of it.

potential of this diet to the masses. so in this diet you have to eat times in a day meals and snacks with not more than hours between each. the main gist of this whole diet is to lower the carbohydrates intake. therefore for each meal you divide your plate into sections st section one palm sized portion of a lean protein. nd and rd section two big fist sized portions of favourable carbohydrates. last but not the least healthy fats. so try a new diet and see the change yourself.   lingering around my balcony and reflecting about  a bunch of rich evocations of the sights echoed
